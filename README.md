# NLP Paper Summaries
This repository contains a list of NLP paper summaries intended to make NLP techniques and topics more approachable and accessible. 

## How to contribute
If you have blogged about an NLP paper or technique or find an interesting read out there, I encourage you to share with our community. To add your blog posts or summaries to this list just hit on the edit button on this [README.md](https://github.com/dair-ai/nlp_paper_summaries/blob/master/README.md). You can then add your entry by modiying the readme file and submitting a PR which will be reviewed before going live. Thanks. If you are facing any issues submitting your PR, just send me an email at ellfae@gmail.com or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/omarsar0).

If you would like to contribute by blogging about an NLP paper/technique, you can check out our suggestion/guidance at this [issue](https://github.com/dair-ai/dair-ai.github.io/issues/23).

## TODO List
- [ ] Categorize papers; I am aiming to categorize paper summaries by using the categories in the [NLP Progress](http://nlpprogress.com/) or prominent tracks used in NLP conferences
- [ ] Include more info about papers, excerpt, authors, year, etc.
- [ ] Move all paper summaries to GitHub so others can also edit, contribute, and review
