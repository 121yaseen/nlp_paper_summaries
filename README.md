# NLP Paper Summaries
This repository contains a list of NLP paper summaries intended to make NLP techniques and topics more approachable and accessible. Work in progress. There is a lot more to be added/improved in the coming days.

If you have blogged about an NLP paper or technique or find an interesting read out there, I encourage you to share with our community. To add your blog posts or summaries to this list just hit on the edit button on the corresponding README.md file inside each of the folders. You can then add your entry by modifying the readme file and submitting a PR which will be reviewed before going live. Alternatively, we can work on transferring the summaries to this repo itself so as to make them more accessible, which is what I am currently doing with some of my own paper summaries below.

If you would like to contribute by blogging about an NLP paper/technique, you can check out our suggestion/guidance at this [issue](https://github.com/dair-ai/dair-ai.github.io/issues/23).

And if you need any ideas on how else to contribute to this repo, take a look in the [issues](https://github.com/dair-ai/nlp_paper_summaries/issues) section. We are in need of maintainers.

For now, I have adopted a few tracks from [ACL](https://acl2020.org/calls/papers/) for the grouping but this can change based on the granularity of grouping that is needed. Open to ideas here.

Note that we currently provide the source of the where the summary originated from. We are working with a few authors to migrate the content directly to this repo so that summaries are centralized and easily accessible. This also simplifies the way others can contribute to this project. When a summary has been fully migrated to this repo, we will tag the summary as "GitHub" under the "Summary" tab of the tables below to identify them easily.

We are including an extra __TL;DR__ section wherever applicable. This is not meant as a full-fledged summary but rather covers the key points of each paper and serves as a refresher for those who have previously encountered the paper.

If you are facing any issues submitting your PR, just send me an email at ellfae@gmail.com or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/omarsar0).
