# NLP Paper Summaries
This repository contains a list of NLP paper summaries intended to make NLP techniques and topics more approachable and accessible. Work in progress, there is a lot more to be added/improved in the coming days.

## How to contribute
If you have blogged about an NLP paper or technique or find an interesting read out there, I encourage you to share with our community. To add your blog posts or summaries to this list just hit on the edit button on this [README.md](https://github.com/dair-ai/nlp_paper_summaries/blob/master/README.md). You can then add your entry by modiying the readme file and submitting a PR which will be reviewed before going live. Thanks. If you are facing any issues submitting your PR, just send me an email at ellfae@gmail.com or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/omarsar0).

If you would like to contribute by blogging about an NLP paper/technique, you can check out our suggestion/guidance at this [issue](https://github.com/dair-ai/dair-ai.github.io/issues/23). 

For now, I have adopted a few tracks from [ACL](https://acl2020.org/calls/papers/) for the grouping but this can change based on the granularity of grouping that is needed. Open to ideas here.

## TODO List
- [ ] Categorize papers; I am aiming to categorize paper summaries by using the categories in the [NLP Progress](http://nlpprogress.com/) or prominent tracks used in NLP conferences; if you have any suggestions/questions please open an issue or send me a message directly on Twitter or via email.
- [ ] Include more info about papers, excerpt, authors, year, etc.
- [ ] More paper summaries are coming!
- [ ] Move all paper summaries to GitHub so others can also edit, contribute, and review
